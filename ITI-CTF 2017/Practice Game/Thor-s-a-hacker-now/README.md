## Write-up

We can see that the content of thor.txt is generated by hexdump.
First 2 bytes show that the original file is a Lzip file.

We recover the file and decompress it with the following commands:
```
cat thor.txt | xxd -r > thor.lz
lzip -d thor.lz
```

We get file "thor" after decompression.
We have to check its file type.
```
[root@localhost pra]# file thor
thor: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
```
It is a JPEG file.
The flag is inside the image file.
